This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that Expo doesn't support or doesn't have the necessary native modules linked correctly.  This is often related to using libraries that rely on native components, particularly in Android builds. The error message might not always point directly to the problematic library but rather manifest as a more general build failure.  Debugging requires careful examination of your dependencies and ensuring compatibility with Expo's managed workflow.  For example, if you try to use a library that requires complex native Android configurations, you might encounter this issue.
