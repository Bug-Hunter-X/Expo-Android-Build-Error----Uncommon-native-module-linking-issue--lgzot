# Expo Android Build Error: Uncommon Native Module Linking Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug encountered during Expo Android builds.  The issue is often caused by incompatibilities between third-party libraries and Expo's managed workflow. The error message itself can be vague, making diagnosis challenging.

The `bug.js` file shows an example project that may trigger the error. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution, which may involve replacing the problematic library, configuring native modules manually (if feasible in the Expo managed workflow), or simplifying the code to avoid the library altogether.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo prebuild` and `expo start`.
3. Attempt to build the Android APK.  You'll likely encounter the described error.  If not, try adding libraries known to produce issues.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying and addressing the library dependency causing the native module linking problem. This often requires checking for and using Expo-compatible alternatives or restructuring the application logic to avoid the problematic libraries altogether.  Sometimes, manual linking in the Expo environment may be required, however, this is not always straightforward in a managed Expo environment and might require ejecting from Expo.
