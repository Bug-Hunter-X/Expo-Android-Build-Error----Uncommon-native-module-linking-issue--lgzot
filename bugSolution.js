The solution depends heavily on the specific library causing the issue. However, here's a general approach:

1. **Identify the Culprit:** Carefully examine the error logs. Although the message may be general, look for clues that indicate a specific library or module. Tools like `expo diagnostics` can help identify potential conflicts.
2. **Expo-Compatible Alternatives:** Search for Expo-compatible alternatives to the problematic library. Expo's documentation and community forums are helpful resources.
3. **Simplify or Refactor:** If possible, restructure your code to avoid using the problematic library or functionality.  This might require changing your approach to achieve similar results.
4. **(Advanced/Risky) Manual Linking (Ejecting):** As a last resort, and only if absolutely necessary, you might consider ejecting from Expo to gain complete control over the native module linking. This however is highly discouraged, since it significantly complicates maintenance and updates.

**Example (Illustrative, requires context of the actual problem):**

//bug.js
//Illustrative: This might use a non-expo compatible library
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import SomeNativeModule from 'some-native-module'; // problematic library

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <SomeNativeModule />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

//bugSolution.js
//Example solution might use a different, expo compatible library
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
//Replaced with expo-compatible alternative
//import SomeNativeModule from 'some-native-module'; 

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Alternative solution!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
